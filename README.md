This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript: failure to handle empty parameters. The `bug.vbs` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.vbs` shows the corrected version.  The original code lacked an explicit check for empty parameters, leading to runtime errors. The solution adds a check using `IsEmpty()` and an `Exit Function` statement to gracefully handle such cases.
